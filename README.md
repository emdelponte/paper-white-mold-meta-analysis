> Lehner, M. S., Pethybridge, S. J., Meyer, M. C., & Del Ponte, E. M. (2016). Meta-analytic modelling of the incidence-yield and incidence-sclerotial production relationships in soybean white mould epidemics. Plant Pathol. doi:10.1111/ppa.12590

In the paper, the relationships between soybean white mold incidence (inc) and soybean yield (yld) and inc and sclerotia weight (scl) was studied in 35 uniform field trials across several locations and four years in Brazil. The original data was obtained from individual tables for each trial published in a scientific report. These relationships were summarized using meta-analytic modeling approaches. The effect-sizes summarized were the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the intercept and slopes of a mixed, random-coefficients, model fitted to the data of 35 and 29 studies for the inc-yld and inc-scl relationships, respectively.
